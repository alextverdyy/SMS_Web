# Stepper Motor Simulation Tool for 3D Printers

This is a web-based simulation tool for analyzing stepper motor behavior in 3D printing applications. It allows you to simulate and compare motor performance in real time, making it easier to choose the right motor for your setup.

## Inspiration and Credits

This project is inspired by and uses data derived from:

- [MSzturc/the100](https://github.com/MSzturc/the100)
- [eddietheengineer/documentation](https://github.com/eddietheengineer/documentation)

Huge thanks to the maintainers and contributors of those repositories!

## Features

- Accurate simulation based on the same calculations as the original Excel sheets
- Easily add multiple motors to your current simulation session
- Real-time graphing and behavior visualization
- Shareable simulation sessions (custom motors are embedded in the link)

## Planned Features

- Stepper motor recommendation system based on your requirements
- Community-driven motor database with public submissions
- Improved user interface and experience
- Search and filter functionality for available motors
- Purchase links for listed stepper motors
- "Popular motors" section with pre-simulated data
